#+TITLE: Zig Notes

This repo is just my playground to learn and try to take notes on things I learn
in Zig. These notes are not going to be a perfect read, but are rather
intended to be reference documents for snippets of knowledge or examples. These
notes are just little jots I make while I learn and will include spelling
mistakes, bad grammar, and a complete disregard for past, present, and future
tense.

Inaccuracies are also quite likely if you are viewing this repository in the
future as at the time of writing this Zig is still not officially released and
is currently at version 0.15.2. Some aspects of the language are still under
development and this is especially true of things like the standard lib.

I would recommend viewing the content of this repository in this order:
- [[./HelloWorld/README.org][HelloWorld]] :: This is just your standard hello world program.
